# A sharper exponent for integer multiplication

**Community research maintained by Douglas Colkitt — conditional on the original
OpenAI #109 framework.**

## Current reviewed result: paired cubes and shared cores

The construction contributed by **[icekylinx](https://github.com/icekylinx)** in
[PR #144](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/144), building on
[PR #130](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/130), gives

$$
T(n)=O\!\left(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}\right),\qquad
\kappa=\frac{4609169}{10000000000}=4.609169\times10^{-4}.
$$

A signed paired-cube producer and coordinate-star centers complete the
identity using the original source registers. Completed dirty cores reuse
one auxiliary bank across three orthogonal blocks, adopting an664's PR #128
sharing principle. The bit branch selects certified gauges from the retained
PR #97 / Swapnil word. All local transitions, copied centers, complement
calls, finite routers and rare-class fallback remain charged. The analytic,
uniform-recursion and fixed-tape hypotheses are retained.

This is **9.03 times the preceding reviewed main saving**, approximately
`2^-11.0832`: above `2^-12` and below `2^-11`. It measures the asymptotic
exponent saving, not a practical runtime speedup.

## Preceding three-stage cover extension

The construction contributed by **icekylinx**, extending
[PR #115](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/115), gives

$$
T(n)=O\!\left(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}\right),\qquad
\kappa=\frac{3146011}{10000000000}=3.146011\times10^{-4}.
$$

Three signed shears on a regular Cayley cover align all interstage data
frames. The complex branch combines eumemic's PR #117 local DAG with
arbitrary-subspace Clifford frames; the bit branch retains the PR #97 /
Swapnil physical word and uses a batched weighted q-adic cover. Local
transitions, copied centers, rare-class fallback, finite routers and
internal row borrowing are charged. The retained analytic and fixed-tape
hypotheses still apply.

## Preceding partial-gauge extension

The construction contributed by **icekylinx**, extending
[PR #104](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/104), gives

$$
T(n)=O\!\left(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}\right),\qquad
\kappa=\frac{7237}{78125000}=9.26336\times10^{-5}.
$$

It applies the stopped whole-projector bit interface to the physical deferred
word of Zhihao Chen's PR #97, based on Swapnil Jain's witness. The new complex
producer combines cyclic interval contractions, pair-first cube assembly,
compatible frame enlargement and partial source gauges. Every residual,
endpoint correction and target-data transition is charged. The bound retains
the analytic and fixed-tape hypotheses of the preceding construction.

## Preceding stopped product-ring extension

The new construction contributed by **icekylinx**, extending merged
[PR #36](https://github.com/CrocSwap/integer-mult-bounds/pull/36), gives

$$
T(n)=O\!\left(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}\right),\qquad
\kappa=\frac{194869}{2500000000}=7.79476\times10^{-5}.
$$

It combines a stopped product-ring bit interchange on `(23,23)` with an
all-disjoint rational-center complex network on `(24,24)`. The new generic
opposite-bank factorization pays one reversed child per projector rank;
atom adapters, ordinary leaves, endpoint copies and the exact denominator-21
grid are included in the proof. The bound retains the original analytic
and fixed-tape hypotheses.

The maintainer-reviewed community checkpoint below remains its own result
and validation record.

## Historical reviewed community checkpoint

The reviewed community witness gives

$$
T(n)=O\!\left(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}\right),\qquad
\boxed{\kappa=\frac{25508460085039}{500000000000000000}
=5.1016920170078\times10^{-5}>2^{-15}}.
$$

This is **23.71% above the preceding PR #49 release** and remains below 2^-14.
It is an improvement in the asymptotic exponent saving, not a measured runtime
speedup. The model and general reduction are inherited from OpenAI's
[*Integer multiplication below n log n*](https://github.com/openai/math/tree/adc7f1241b42e322a6451854ab7e4b4c146bf78a/preprints/Integer-multiplication-below-n-log-n-September-23-2026).

## What changed

**Avi Eisenberg's interval strips and core-aware pair assembly (#62)** arrange
additions to allow more physical wire reuse. Combined with **eumemic's joint
frame compiler (#57)**, this yields the strongest finite network in this batch.
**Alejandro Zarzuelo Urdiales's exact parameter refinement and scoped Lean
certificate (#61)** supply the selected numerical value.

The bit network has m=575 and 137,151,806 physical roles; its certified recursive
saving is 102039046058023/2000000000000000000. The complex network retains saving
717/10^7. All recursive children, workspace restoration, copied centers and
endpoint costs remain charged. The seven final exponent margins are strictly positive.

The preceding combination of Avi's skip-prefix strips (#53), **Rohan Gupta's
dual-suffix layout (#55)**, eumemic's compiler and **Chafik Boukhalfa's composition
and ranked reclamation (#58/#60)** is also fully retained and reviewed.

Other reviewed contributions are retained even when their numerical witnesses
are superseded: **RaD's enlarged-frame and clone machinery (#51)**, **Rohan Arun's
positive-frame composition and order searches (#52/#56)**, **Rohan Gupta's parallel
order search (#50)**, **Chafik's original-envelope clones (#54)**, and **Rohan Garg's
split-pair recursion (#59)**. The review records the exact validation scope of each.

superseded and pending work separately. Douglas Colkitt maintains the project,

## Evidence and limits

The [round-two review](docs/research/community-round2-review.md) extends the
[previous follow-up audit](docs/research/community-followup-review.md) and
[PR #39 transfer review](docs/research/community-final-audit.md). The original
#109 framework and retained all-size interfaces remain assumptions. This is not
full formal verification, independent human peer review, a worldwide priority
claim, or a practical multiplication benchmark.

Fresh checks cover complete emitted words and dirty basis vectors, physical
frame transitions, exact fixed-basis profiles, all 4,073,300 data pairs for the
retained geometry, and independent rational recurrence/assembly arithmetic.
The formal packages verify their stated finite/arithmetic contracts. PR #61's
integrated axiom audit contains 169 distinct declarations, including 11 concrete
frontier theorems; its input rows are bound to the replayed finite profile.
They do not formalize the whole multiplication algorithm.

The [review receipt](docs/research/community-round2-validation.json) distinguishes
fresh maintainer checks from contributor-supplied evidence. Earlier witnesses,
patches and attribution remain available. Submissions after #62 are outside this checkpoint's review; exact reviewed heads
are recorded in the ledger.

## Reproduce

```sh
make verify-pair
make verify-joint
make verify-positive
make formal-matrix-verify
# Complete arithmetic, producer, historical and unit-test suite:
make verify
```

Python 3.11+, a C++17 compiler and Boost headers are required for the full
arithmetic suite. The formal targets use their pinned Lean versions. See
[reproduction details](docs/reproducibility.md) and [CI layout](docs/ci-verification.md).

## Historical witnesses and independent patches


Each patch applies independently to the **unmodified** pinned source; they are
alternatives, not a sequence to apply together. The
[result history](docs/research/result-history.md) records the earlier mechanisms
and scoped ceilings. The [preserved research index](docs/research/preserved-research.md)
collects the intermediate compression, routing, Fano, and core searches, including
scoped negative results and reproducible certificates.
